## Overview:
This was my first JS project and the first time I write code actually. 
I always wanted to help people. Coding is a way to help people. I find this way thanks to Discord
and its marvelous API.

ISIER was a bot with a few commands to entertain students (with the possiblity to 
bet for XP and ranks for example) but also a great tools to study.
That was possible thanks to a large archive and some other students willing to contribute by 
sharing their sheets.

I am so greatful to this bot with over a thousand commits. 
But let's be honest, this bot is a real mess as it was my first code ever. 
I cannot maintain its code anymore and have to stop this project.

Hopefully, other bots now replace ISIER.
